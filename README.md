# Koa.js webapp boilerplate

This is a template for writing Koa.js based webapps. It provides basic features
such as

* a pre-configured logger based on [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston),
* a basic config module,
* a gulp development workflow,
* pre-configured middleware for error handling,
* pre-configured caching with koa-cash,
* linting with jscs and jshint and code analysis via TernJS.

Happy building 🔨⛏🔧🏗
